The data is the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same
region in Italy by three different cultivators. There are thirteen different
measurements taken for different constituents found in the three types of
wine.

The data was used with many others for comparing various 
classifiers. The classes are separable, though only RDA 
has achieved 100% correct classification.
