# DaPy - enjoy the tour of data mining

## Introduction
There are amount of data processing library in Python currently, why we need DaPy? 

I met Pandas and Numpy 1 year ago. At that time, I just a beginer in Python and only understood some basic opeartions of Python native syntax. Numpy is fast but hard to use, because it is a little uncomfortable while you use numpy, the reason is the functions in Numpy is a huge different between that in Python native data structures. Every time I wanted to do a opeartion with Pandas or Numpy, the first syntax, which jumped out of my mind, was usually wrong, and I had to find the correct way on Guide Book or Internet. 

I wondered whether it was my personal problem, so I asked my friends and professors around me. However, they gave the almost same answer as mine. Then I imagined that what about developing a new data processing and analysis library, which has a similar using habits with the native Python data structures. And further more, I believe that everyone knows how to use Excel.

Finally, DaPy came out! In DaPy, you can operate the data just like in a Excel File with the familiar syntax you learnt in Python.
