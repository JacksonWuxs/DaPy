## Features
**Convinience** and **efficiency** are the cornerstone of DaPy. 
Since the very beginning, we have designed DaPy to Python's 
native data structures as much as possible and we try to make 
it supports more Python syntax habits. Therefore you can 
adapt to DaPy quickly, if you imagine you are opearting an Excel table.
In addition, we do our best to simplify
the formulas or mathematical models in it, in order to let you 
implement your ideas fluently.   

## Visibly manage diverse data
Every data scientist should have at least one experience in handling the needed datas 
in multiple sources. It is inconvenient to manage or scan datas with amount of 
variables names. In this section, we will simply introduce a data container, which 
represented the ideology of designing DaPy, called *DataSet*.

Not only data scientist, but also a young kid in primary school, are skillful in 
MS Office Excel software. In that case, every data should be contained in a 
*sheet* structures. We draw on ideas from Excel and proposed a data managing structure  
that is [*DataSet*]. 

Here is a example how does it work basically. 

First of all, we have prepared an Excel file which has 3 sheets inside, "Info", "Course", and "Scholarship".
```Python
```
